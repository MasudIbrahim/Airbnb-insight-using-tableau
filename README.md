# An insight into Airbnbs in Seattle in 2016 üè°

### Background info
I used a [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexanderfreberg/airbnb-listings-2016-dataset) from kaggle on Airbnb data to create a visualisation for prospective investors to help them in their search for the most profitable properties, times of year and more.<BR>
I presented my findings by creating a dashboard using Tableau.

### Conclusions
From our visualisations, we can conclude that average price of the property increases as the number of bedrooms also increase.<BR>
The most profitable month of the year was December, followed by August.<BR>
Finally, the zipcode with the highest avg price was 98134.
